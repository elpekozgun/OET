# OET
2D square mesh generator for OLM applications.

 In order to get accurate results from simulation and modeling problems, the inputs of the problems should be well defined and prepared. However, generating inputs on some problem types can be a cumbersome task to do efficiently in terms of time and performance. There are even times where preparing a proper configuration take more time than solving the problem itself. To eliminate this roadblock, a program called OET[2] was designed in order to inputs for OLM solver program. OET is a program that uses a graphical interface where user can draw CAD based objects in 2D environment and prepare a meshed configuration with loading and supports included. OET mesher includes GNUPlot integration, which is the number one choice in scientific program visualization.
